# CNCF SIG Runtime Graduation Review Project Request

## Harbor Graduation Proposal

Since joining the CNCF in [July 2018](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2018/07/31/cncf-to-host-harbor-in-the-sandbox/) as a Sandbox project and in [November 2018](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2018/11/13/harbor-into-incubator/) moving to an Incubating Project, Harbor has built a healthy ecosystem of users, maintainers, and production implementations.

On behalf of the maintainers team, we believe Harbor is ready for the CNCF [Graduation stage](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/process/graduation_criteria.adoc#graduation-stage) and meets the v1.2 criteria. We address the CNCF Technical Due Diligence questions in a separate Google Docs document (referred to as the `Tech-DD` from now on).

*Name of project:* Harbor

*Project Description:* Harbor is an open source cloud native registry that provides trust, compliance, performance, and interoperability. As a private on-premises registry, Harbor fills a gap for organizations that prefer not to use a public or cloud-based registry or want a consistent experience across clouds. Harbor secures images with role-based access control, scans images for vulnerabilities, and signs images as trusted. A CNCF Incubating project, Harbor helps you consistently and securely manage images across cloud native compute platforms like Kubernetes and Docker.

Harbor in essense solves common problems in organizations building cloud native applications by offering them a choice to deploy their own private on-premises registry and apply a consistent policy across artifact management in any cloud

Harbor is currently a CNCF Incubating Project.
